    <section id="about">
      <p>
	We met in January, 2019 during a house party in the midst of a snowstorm.
	Once Julie realized my name wasn't actually Yoni and that I was not attracted to men, we exchanged numbers.
	We've been seeing each other almost every day since.
	After getting engaged before Christmas, 2021 in Quebec city we have been waiting for an opportune moment outside our busy dragonboat summer schedule to host this wedding party. 
	This page contains the essential information for the reception and is fully compatible with terminal browsers like <a href="https://lynx.browser.org/" target="_blank">Lynx</a> or <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/EWW.html" target="_blank">EWW</a> ;)

      <h2>Wedding gifts</h2>
      <p>
      	In Vietnamese weddings it is customary to give money in red envelopes to wish good fortune to the newlyweds.
	We prefer this to traditional western wedding gifts.
