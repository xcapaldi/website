During the summer of 2019, our group generated several thousand macroscopic knots to study non-equilibrium knot formation.
Previous studies on macroscopic knotting generated fairly simple knots that could be simplified and identified by hand.
In our case however, we generated complex knots (as high as 60 strand crossings) so we needed a better method to process the knot images.
[[https://github.com/SPOCKnots/pyknotid][Pyknotid]] is a python package developed as part of Scientific Properties of Complex Knots (SPOCK) collaboration.
It is capable of simplifying 2D knot diagrams and identifying the resulting prime knot.
The main limitation however was getting images of knots into a format that Pyknotid is capable of processing.
To this end, my brother and I wrote a graphical interface with Tkinter which allows the user to draw the knot diagram, arrange strand crossings, simplify the knot and record the results for further analysis.
It is not very polished and a few bugs still exist but the tool has served its purpose well.
We were able to process thousands of complex knots and the resulting paper is currently under review for publication.
