*Abstract:* Here we present a pneumatically-actuated nanofluidic platform that has the capability of dynamically controlling the confinement environment of macromolecules in solution.
Using a principle familiar from classic devices based on soft-lithography, the system uses pneumatic pressure to deflect a thin nitride lid into a nanoslit, confining molecules in an array of cavities embedded in the slit.
We use this system to quantify the interactions of multiple confined DNA chains, a key problem in polymer physics with important implications for nanofluidic device performance and DNA partitioning/organization in bacteria and the eukaryotes.
In particular, we focus on the problem of two-chain confinement, using differential staining of the chains to independently assess the chain conformation, determine the degree of partitioning/mixing in the cavities and assess coupled diffusion of the chain center-of-mass positions.
We find that confinement of more than one chain in the cavity can have a drastic impact on the polymer dynamics and conformation.

This paper was the culmination of my Masters research.
Zezhou Liu and I worked together extensively on this project which is why we decided to co-author the paper.
We were offered a position on the inner cover by the RSC Soft Matter editors.
I created the final cover grapic for publication myself with Google SketchUp for the 3D design combined with real images from the microscope.
