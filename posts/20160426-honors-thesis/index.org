*Abstract:* Polymer crystallization is a complex process which is influenced by a variety of factors.
Atomic force microscopy is used to explore the material properties of polymer crystals.
Poly(ethylene-oxide) is used in a variety of molecular weights as the sample.
In addition, a variety of sample preparation methods and microscopy modes were tested.
A relatively new imaging technique was identified for the characterization of polymer crystals: amplitude modulation-frequency modulation viscoelastic mapping.
This mode was used to measure material properties such as stiffness and dissipation.

An honors thesis submitted to Union College in partial fulfillment of the requirements of the degree of Bachelor of Science.
