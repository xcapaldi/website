#+TITLE: Terminal Braid Knotting Model

I wrote a script to generate (and analyze) knots with a terminal braid knotting model.
Knot are drawn completely in the terminal using unicode box-drawing characters and as such, the raw data can be saved (and read) as text files.
[[https://www.pnas.org/content/104/42/16432][Raymer and Smith]] originally proposed a similar knotting model to describe agitated knot formation.
Knots form at the mobile end of an open string so their model involved a coiled chain where one end was able to move over or under adjacent strands randomly for each time step.
This script extends their model and allows for varying crossing parameters and initial conditions.
In addition, you can control limit which strands are accessible to the terminal end.
It is quite easy to reproduce the results of Raymer and Smith but despite generating tens of thousands of knots with varying parameters, I wasn't able to glean any other useful information.
